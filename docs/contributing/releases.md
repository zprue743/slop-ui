# Versioning and releases

Changesets records consumer-visible package changes and drives semantic versions
and changelogs. Add a Changeset with `pnpm changeset`, select affected publishable
packages, choose patch/minor/major impact, and write a consumer-focused summary.

Internal refactors, tests, and documentation that do not affect a package release
usually need no Changeset. Pre-1.0 versions still require explicit compatibility
judgment; zero-major status is not permission for surprise breakage.

Release automation is intentionally not enabled during the foundation phase.
Packages remain private and nothing in CI publishes artifacts. Before the first
release, maintainers must review package names/ownership, provenance, registry
access, changelog policy, support matrix, and a least-privilege publication
workflow. No agent may publish packages or create releases without explicit
authorization.
