# Component specification: `<Name>`

> Copy this file for every meaningful component. Remove instructional text and
> resolve applicable sections before production implementation.

## Purpose and user problems

What does this component enable, and for whom?

## Non-goals

What related behavior is deliberately outside this component?

## Public API

### Props and configuration

List names, types, defaults, invariants, and interaction between options.

### v-model contracts

Define values, update timing, controlled/uncontrolled behavior, and reset rules.

### Events, callbacks, slots, and exposed methods

Define payloads, timing, cancellation, and progressive escape hatches.

## State model

Describe states and valid transitions, including controlled versus uncontrolled
ownership.

### Loading, empty, disabled, read-only, and error states

Define behavior and precedence when states overlap.

### Async behavior

Define races, cancellation, stale results, failures, and announcements.

## Consumer data

Document assumed shapes, property/nested-path access, typed accessors, key and
identity callbacks, adapters, object identity, and mutation policy.

## Accessibility contract

### Semantics and relationships

Define native elements, roles, names, descriptions, states, and relationships.

### Keyboard interaction

List every supported key and behavior in each relevant state.

### Focus behavior

Define entry, movement, visible focus, restoration, trapping, and disabled items.

### Assistive technology expectations

Describe announcements and intended reading/interaction model.

## Rendering and customization

Define simple configuration, callbacks, slots/rendering, lower-level primitives,
and stable semantic styling hooks. Do not make internal wrapper nesting the API.

## Environment behavior

### SSR and hydration

Define deterministic markup, browser-only behavior, and hydration concerns.

### Mobile and touch

Define gestures, pointer parity, target sizing, viewport, and virtual keyboard
behavior where relevant.

## Performance

Define expected data scale, complexity constraints, measurement approach,
identity/caching rules, and virtualization considerations.

## Composition

List existing primitives/capabilities reused and explain any intentional
duplication.

## Test plan

- Required framework-neutral unit tests
- Required Vue component tests
- Required browser tests
- Required accessibility and keyboard tests
- Required compile-time/type inference tests
- Required regression fixtures

## Documentation plan

List API reference, ordinary examples, advanced examples, accessibility guidance,
and edge-case documentation.

## Compatibility and release impact

Identify public contracts, potential breaking changes, deprecation/migration
needs, and Changeset impact.

## Open architectural questions

List unresolved choices, their alternatives, and the reviewer needed to resolve
them. Production implementation must not silently decide material public issues.
